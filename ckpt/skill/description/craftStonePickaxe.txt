async function craftStonePickaxe(bot) {
    // The function crafts a stone pickaxe using cobblestones and sticks. It checks the inventory for the required materials and explores to collect cobblestones if needed. After obtaining enough cobblestones, it ensures the availability of sticks by gathering them from oak logs. Once all necessary materials are collected, it places a crafting table, crafts a stone pickaxe, and notifies the success. If any materials are insufficient, it informs the user accordingly.
