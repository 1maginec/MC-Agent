    // The function is about collecting 2 oak logs using mining operations in Minecraft. It checks the inventory for oak logs; if a sufficient amount is already collected, the task is completed. Otherwise, it searches for oak logs within a certain distance and mines them to reach the required quantity. If no oak logs are found nearby, it explores the surroundings until locating oak logs. After mining, it performs a final check on the oak log count in the inventory to determine task completion.
